This is my final project about embeded image processing with stm32WB55RG and OV7670 camera module.
Some parst of this repo is taken from : https://github.com/anasvag575/STM32WB55_OV7670_Project/tree/master

I basically benefited from the below Arduino code for camera register settings. I tried this also with Arduino and it works.

However, I cannot get the right images from stm, I used the python code for image saving.
This is one of the images I got, I expected YUV422 format, and checked the related registers however the result is not as expected.
